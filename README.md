## FAQs

### What is the Librarium?
  The Librarium is a no-code interface to help authors store words on the blockchain. Wallets containing a Publishing Pass will be able to connect the Librarium and write content to chain as well as revoke transactions.

### How do I publish?
1. Go to The Librarium [Publish page](https://librarium.dev/publish).
2. Connect your wallet (this wallet must contain a Publishing Pass)
3. Fill out the required information and click “Record”.
4. Confirm and execute the transaction via your wallet.

### What does the Revoke function do?
  Anything published to the Librarium is stored on-chain, permanently. However, we have created a “Revoke” function to allow authors and publishers to remove stories from showing up in the Librarium or any downstream applications (i.e. The Eye).

### Do I need to format my text before I publish to the Librarium?
  Yes. The Librarium requires that your content be written in markdown format to render correctly as HTML. The Librarium has a built-in editor which allows you to see how your markdown will render when published. Alternatively, you can use one of many free online markdown editors. [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app#) is a great option with a simple example preloaded to help you if you are new to using markdown. **If you use a third-party editor double check the formatting in the Librarium editor to ensure that it renders properly before recording it.**

### What is a Publishing Pass?
A Publishing Pass is an ERC-1155 NFT which allows the holder privileges to publish and revoke transactions on the Librarium.

### How do I get a Publishing Pass?
Publishing Passes can be purchased from [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/librarium) or you can request a Publishing Pass [here](https://tfp0m1w5j9m.typeform.com/to/gV2oFyQI).
